# Movie Tracking

#### Project Description:
This project is an interactive MATLAB-based system designed to manage movie bookings and display movie statistics.
The application allows users to browse available movies by date, select movie genres, and purchase tickets.
Additionally, users can view statistics on the most-watched movies from the past week, with visualizations in the form of a message box or a bar chart.
The system is built using GUI components such as date pickers, dropdown menus, and interactive buttons, providing a ideal user experience.

#### Main Features:
\- *Available Movies:* Select a date to view movies available on that day, with the option to filter by genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Horror etc).

\- *Buy Tickets:* Purchase one or more tickets by selecting a movie, specifying the movie date, and adjusting the ticket quantity. In parallel, the user can view the most-watched movies from the previous week.

\- *Most Watched Movies:* View a list of the most-watched movies from the past week. A button allows the user to see the number of views for each day, and another button generates a bar chart to visualize the data.

#### Documentation:
Detailed setup instructions, code explanations, and any additional explanations are available in the attached documentation.
